                <p>
                    <b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</b> (31 October 1875 â€“ 15 December 1950) was an Indian statesman and a
                    key figure in the country's struggle for independence. He served as the first Deputy Prime Minister
                    and Home Minister of India. Patel was instrumental in the integration of over 560 princely states
